## F1 Simulation Project
This project is a simulation of a Formula 1 race, which takes in different race parameters like tire degradation, curvature of the track, and other conditions, and runs a strategy engine to return the best strategy to be used by a particular car on the track at any given lap. The simulation considers different factors that affect a car's performance, such as fuel consumption, tire wear, and pit stops, to determine the optimal strategy for each lap.

# Project Overview
The F1 simulation project is built using C++ programming language and provides a command-line interface for the user to input various race parameters. The simulation engine takes the input parameters and runs the strategy engine to determine the best strategy for the car on the track. The output of the simulation engine is the lap-by-lap strategy that the car should follow to complete the race in the fastest possible time.

# Input Parameters
The following are the input parameters required by the simulation engine:

Track Curvature: This parameter describes the curvature of the track, which affects the car's speed and acceleration.

Tire Degradation: This parameter describes how quickly the car's tires degrade, which affects the car's grip and handling.

Fuel Consumption: This parameter describes the rate at which the car consumes fuel, which affects the car's weight and speed.

Pit Stop Time: This parameter describes the time it takes for the car to stop in the pit for refueling and tire change.

# Strategy Engine
The strategy engine is the core of the F1 simulation project, which takes in the input parameters and determines the optimal strategy for each lap of the race. The strategy engine considers various factors such as track conditions, tire wear, fuel consumption, and pit stops to determine the optimal lap time and the best tire to use for each lap. The strategy engine also considers the overall race strategy, such as whether to go for a two-stop or three-stop strategy, to optimize the car's performance over the entire race.

# Output
The output of the simulation engine is the lap-by-lap strategy that the car should follow to complete the race in the fastest possible time. The output includes the lap number, the tire to use for that lap, and whether the car needs to stop in the pit for refueling or tire change. The simulation engine also provides the overall race time and the number of pit stops required to complete the race.

# Conclusion
The F1 simulation project provides a powerful tool for race strategists to optimize their car's performance on the track. The project considers various race parameters to determine the best strategy for each lap and provides a lap-by-lap strategy that can help drivers and teams win races. The project can also be extended to include more sophisticated algorithms and machine learning models to provide even more accurate race strategies.
